# ### introducing arithmetic expression examples.
# 
# Exploring the World of Arithmetic Expressions
# Arithmetic expressions are the building blocks of mathematical calculations, allowing us to combine numbers and operators to perform various operations. Let's embark on a journey to explore some common and interesting arithmetic expression examples:
# 
# Basic Arithmetic:
# 
# Addition: Combine numbers using the + operator, e.g., 2 + 3 = 5.
# Subtraction: Find the difference between numbers using the - operator, e.g., 8 - 4 = 4.
# Multiplication: Multiply numbers using the * operator, e.g., 3 * 5 = 15.
# Division: Divide numbers using the / operator, e.g., 10 / 2 = 5.

x= 2
y=2
z=3
q=x*y+z


# In[2]:

hours= minutes/60


# ## Objectives
# 
# This Jupyter Notebook aims to achieve the following goals:
# 
# * **Introduce and explore arithmetic expressions:** Gain a solid understanding of basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# * **Demonstrate the order of operations:** Apply PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right) to correctly evaluate expressions.
# * **Present advanced arithmetic concepts:** Delve into concepts like modulus operator, exponents, and combined operations for more complex calculations.
# * **Highlight real-world applications:** Showcase how arithmetic expressions are used in various fields like geometry, scientific analysis, finance, and algorithm development.
# * **Encourage hands-on practice:** Provide examples and encourage experimentation with different expressions to solidify understanding.
# 
# By pursuing these objectives, we aim to enhance your grasp of arithmetic fundamentals and their valuable applications in various domains.
